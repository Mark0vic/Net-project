# Net-project
Some of my Packet Tracer networks, made while preparing for the CCNA exam. <br>
Atomic commits for every new implemented feature and change, starting from P1_1, all documented in P1.txt. <br>
Susceptible to further expansions in Wireless, Security, L7 services and Redundancy. 

Network design and best practices were not a focus of this project.
